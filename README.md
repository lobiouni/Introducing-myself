# Hello!
I am an ecologist passionate about data visualization and analysis. I discovered R programming language during my master's, and after much trial and error, I have been using R as a tool to translate complex data for other people to understand. I recently came across a really cool online course on data science skills more broadly, including data analysis and storytelling using Python, Pandas e Seaborn, SQL, Data Viz with Google Data Studio, and Data Lake in AWS.
