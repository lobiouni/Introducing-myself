# Hello!
I am an ecologist passionate about water and all tiny organisms that play an essential role in aquatic ecosystems. I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina (UFSC, Brazil) and an environmental consulting. My work aims to understand the impact of anthropogenic activities on biodiversity and the functioning of freshwater ecosystems by combining biomonitoring data and small-scale experiments, together with a wide variety and modern techniques for analyzing data, to better understand, predict and manage biodiversity responses to environmental change. I primarily use phytoplankton and zooplankton as research models, but I also have experience with periphyton, macrophytes, macroinvertebrates, and fishes.

I recently came across a really cool online course on data science skills more broadly, including data analysis e storytelling using Python, Pandas e Seaborn, and also SQL, Data Viz with Google Data Studio, AWS DataLake Creation, and Data Ingestion with Pipeline Automation.
