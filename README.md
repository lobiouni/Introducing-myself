# Hello!
I am an freshwater ecologist passionate about data visualization and analysis. I started getting really interested in R programming language and statistics during my master's, and after much trial and error, I have been using R as a tool to translate complex data in environmental science for other people to understand. I recently came across a really cool online course on data science skills more broadly, including data analysis and storytelling using Python, Pandas e Seaborn, SQL, Data Viz with Google Data Studio, and Data Lake in AWS.
