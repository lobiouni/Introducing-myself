# Hello!
I am a freshwater ecologist passionate about data visualization and analysis. I started getting really interested in R programming language and statistics during my master's, and after much trial and error, I have been using R as a tool to communicate data and scientific findings effectively to the wider stakeholders involved. I recently came across a really cool online course on data science skills more broadly, including data analysis and storytelling using Python, Pandas e Seaborn, SQL, Data Viz with Google Data Studio, and Data Lake in AWS.

I have a wide background in water quality, biodiversity conservation and monitoring programs. I completed my PhD at Santa Catarina Federal University in Florian√≥polis, Brazil studying the impact of anthropogenic activities on biodiversity and the functioning of freshwater ecosystems. In my technique, I combine biomonitoring data and small-scale experiments, together with a wide variety and modern techniques for analyzing data, to better understand, predict and manage biodiversity responses to environmental change.
